# Fishing_Rewards

Disclaimer - I am not responsible for anyone using this plugin in a non-eula compliant way. If you use this plugin or anything pointing in my way. It's your own fault that's what you get for breaking the rules my guy.
This is a plugin that currently only works with 1.8 and below servers. I'll get it up to speed once im out of things to do with it.

The reason I have put this up is for people to learn from this or let people who do know how to create plugins and would like to fork a copy then they can.


To explain what this plugin does in a short manner is checks for when the player has actually fished something up, check to see if they are using our rod and grab the Tier and XP off the Rod and break it down to if they get a reward and what reward.

If you wanna see how the recipe is created look in the onEnable.

If you would like to see how the JSON is loaded into the plugin I would check out the JSONGuy class

and if you would like to see how I figure their reward and take away the xp and the fish being tossed to the player check OnFished class
